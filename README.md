# qtcreator-opt [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/h4tr3d/qtcreator-opt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/h4tr3d/qtcreator-opt)

Use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/h4tr3d/qtcreator-opt) for building and packaging
Qt Creator from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) that installed into `/opt` and can co-exists with other QtC
installations and deploy them to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/h4tr3d/qtcreator-opt/releases)
so it can be used as repository in Arch Linux.

This Qt Creator version uses master branch to build but fixed commit number that updates after minor testing.

This also allows to build and prepare third party plugins.
